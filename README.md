# COVID_19_Impact_on_Different_Counties
## Background
COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the United States, and as the pandemic becomes more severe, it is important to ask: which US counties are the most vulnerable to the pandemic based on population characteristics and hospital bed availability?

## Data
Looking at data from the [US Census][https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2018/demo/popest/2018-fips.html], (New York Times)[https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data], (American Community Survey)[https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=United%20States&g=0100000US.050000&tid=ACSST5Y2018.S0101&hidePreview=false&vintage=2018&layer=VT_2018_050_00_PY_D1&cid=DP05_0001E&t=Populations%20and%20People], (Johns Hopkins University)[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19], and the (Department of Homeland Security)[https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals], we can determine how counties can implement the most effective policies against COVID-19 based on their characteristics.
